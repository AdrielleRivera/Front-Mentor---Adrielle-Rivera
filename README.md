## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- VS Code
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Chatgpt 4.0
- W3school tutorials

### What I learned

- I have realized that learning by discovery and trial & error is a good opportunity for me to grow as a coder. This advice was given to me by my coach in Learn Computer Today Philippines.

- "Remember that is code is all about coomunicating with the human developers, write your code in a way that someone else or even you in 5 years can still read what you wrote" - Yuriy

- To create logos, use "a" or anchor tag

- max-width - based on my understanding, puts the element in the middle part.

- "Don't forget to add "alt" in img - Grace-Snow

- Margin creates space around the element! "Outside"

- Padding also creates space around the element but "Inside"
  
- Navbar = creates list of link which is the goal of this project.
  
- I have learned and understand how ul and li tag works for social media.
  
- I have learned how to use an anchor tag for linking social medias. a href ="(link)"
  
- I have learned how to use proper indentation, very helpful for debugging and looking at the parent tag.
  
- (I was constantly reminded by Grace-Snow, but I didn't listen. I only applied it at the end, thanks for understanding me Coach Grace! XD)
  
- Without Display Flex = The elements only stay in the left.

- I have learned how to use Width and Height here. I understand how it works.
  
- "Avoid using width and height" - AlexKMarshall
  
- Text Align:Center = this css code brings the element in the middle.
  
- Flex basis is much better than width. = I agree with this because I also experimented it.
  
- Padding: 30px(This side is the vertical, it goes up when you change it) 20px(This side is Horizon. It goes left and right)

```

### Continued development

HTML structure - I am not yet that confident with this, but I know I can do better
CSS style - Approriate codes for giving style to the HTML. What I usually do is that I take notes of every code and re-read to understand how it works. I always ask advice from Frontend mentors.
Core Concepts - I need to understand how to follow the design.

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/html/ - This helped me for understanding basic structure of HTML and CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. It helped me understand the explanation of each tags, elements and css styles, very helpful for new beginners.

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc - Dbarkz, my coach from UK shared this to me to explain more about calc

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKoajPPWpmo&list=PLr6-GrHUlVf8JIgLcu3sHigvQjTw_aC9C - Basic CSS tutorial for beginner playlist, very helpful for me, I was able to understand and visualize CSS because of this.
