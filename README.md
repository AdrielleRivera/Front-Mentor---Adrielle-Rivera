## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.



### Continued development

HTML structure - I am not yet that confident with this, but I know I can do better
CSS style - Approriate codes for giving style to the HTML. What I usually do is that I take notes of every code and re-read to understand how it works. I always ask advice from Frontend mentors.
Core Concepts - I need to understand how to follow the design.

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/html/ - This helped me for understanding basic structure of HTML and CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. It helped me understand the explanation of each tags, elements and css styles, very helpful for new beginners.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc - Dbarkz, my coach from UK shared this to me to explain more about calc
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKoajPPWpmo&list=PLr6-GrHUlVf8JIgLcu3sHigvQjTw_aC9C - Basic CSS tutorial for beginner playlist, very helpful for me, I was able to understand and visualize CSS because of this.
